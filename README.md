# Dotfiles

This repository is a collection of all configurations and generally useful scripts I want to use on different machines.

## macOS setup

To install on macOS I have a very nice pipeline for nix, it can be used with this command:
`curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EnderGnar/dotfiles/refs/heads/master/scripts/macos-setup.sh | sh -s`
